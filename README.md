This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks: 

1. **matrix_factorization.ipynb**: demonstrates the synthetic experiment discussed in the paper. 
2. **hf_implementation.ipynb**: provides instructions and examples on how to apply our method using models from Huggingface. 


These notebooks are designed to be self-contained and should work seamlessly in up-to-date environments (e.g., numpy, torch, transformers, matplotlib). 

You can use these notebooks directly in your existing environments without additional setup.
